## Implementation Plan

To complete the implementation across the entire website, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Update Home Page Components First**
   - Start with the HeroSection as it's the most prominent part of the site
   - Update the remaining home page components in order of visual importance

2. **Update Main Navigation Pages**
   - About Us page and its components
   - Solutions landing page
   - Engagement Model page

3. **Update Utility Pages**
   - Thank You page
   - 404 Not Found page

4. **Update Remaining Solution & Engagement Pages**
   - Complete the remaining solution pages
   - Update all engagement model pages

5. **Testing & Fine-tuning**
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Ensure proper text casing throughout
   - Verify line breaks appear at natural points

## Estimated Effort

- **High-Priority Updates:** ~8-10 hours (Home page, About page, major sections)
- **Medium-Priority Updates:** ~6-8 hours (Solution pages, Engagement pages)
- **Low-Priority Updates:** ~2-4 hours (Utility pages, minor components)

Total estimated time: 16-22 hours to fully implement the global text styling system across all pages.
